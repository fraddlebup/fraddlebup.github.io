      <p>Another easy day of my AP Neuroscience and Applied Physics classes!</p>
      <p>After school I went to hang out with my friend Bradley (who is my best friend). We went to go get sandwiches at In-N-Out.</p>
      <p>On the way home, he told me about this rumor about a <b>haunted website</b>.. He said it was some kind of weird page with a creepy duck face and a password..  </p>
      <p>Supposedly, everyone who has visited it gets possessed by some dead duck thing and starts having weird dreams and speaking in tongues and saying weird stuff over and over like "shnust", and "lard" </p>
      <p>He said he thinks he found the website, and that he would show me at his computer at home.</p>
      <p>I don't believe in that kind of stuff but I was curious so I went to follow him, but on the way back he got hit by a car again, so I guess I'll have to hop on Warcraft 3 and play DotA until he's out of the ER and can show me.</p>
